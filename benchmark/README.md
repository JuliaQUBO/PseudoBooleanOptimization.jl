# Benchmark

This benchmark suite should encompass performance measurements for

- [ ] Constructors
- [ ] Operators
  - [ ] `+`
  - [ ] `-`
  - [ ] `*`
  - [ ] `/`
  - [ ] `^`

Operators should be evaluated for all pseudo-Boolean function implementations and using different coefficient distributions.
